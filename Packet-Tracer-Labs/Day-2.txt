Lab 2 â€“ Cabling Lab :

In this lab, I designed and cabled a multi-layered network topology using Cisco Packet Tracer. The connections were made using appropriate cable types, considering Auto MDI-X was disabled. Fiber types were selected based on distance.

Single-mode fiber was used for the long-distance link between Router R1 and R3 (3 km).
Multimode fiber was used between Router R3 and R4 (250 meters).

UTP Straight-through cables were used to connect:

  Routers to switches
  Switches to PCs/Server

UTP Crossover cables were used between switches.
All links were connected as per the given topology labels and tested for proper connectivity.


        Devices Used:

| Device Type | Device Name(s) |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| Routers     | R1, R2, R3, R4 |
| Switches    | SW1 to SW8     |
| PCs         | PC1, PC2, PC3  |
| Server      | SRV1           |
